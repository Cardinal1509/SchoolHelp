Known Bugs:
Script stops listening after the computer has gone to sleep
After opening the .exe version it will take up to 10 seconds to become responsive
If you run the automatic login with a saved password, it won't replace the text that is already there
Important Notes:
If using the .exe version, make sure to run init.exe to setup the text files otherwise the script will crash
Info:
Uses pyautogui to emulate clicks and mouse movement meaning user can't use keyboard/mouse while a website is being opened!
Working on tests where users may be able to use their mouse while logging in. :)
Put Schoology user name in text file called "SchoologyUsername.txt"
Put Schoology password in text file called "SchoologyPassword.txt"
You can use the "init.py" file to do this(or init.exe)
